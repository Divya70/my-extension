<br/>

There are numerous excellent Extensions. However, I couldn't find one that isn't boring. So i made this pretty cool's tab.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on only something that deserves. A project that solves a problem and helps others.


Of course, no extension will serve all demands since your needs may be different. So We'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have reviewed to expanding this Extension!
